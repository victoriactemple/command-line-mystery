head -n 20 people
Try poking around what's in a file by using the 'head' command:

  head -n 20 people

This will show you the first 20 lines of the 'people'

cat hint 2
Try using grep to search for the clues in the crimescene file:

	grep "CLUE" crimescene

cd mystery
ls
 grep "CLUE" crimescene
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

In order to track down our potential witness, we need to figure out where she lives.

Try using 'head' on some of the files like 'people' and 'vehicles' and see where we might find that.

"Interview" the two possible witnesses by reading the correct line from the streets they live on:

	head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This will give you just line 173 of Mattapan street, because it will take first 173 lines, and then take
the last line from those.
