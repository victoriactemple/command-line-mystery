# Command Line Mystery

**Objective:** Solve the mystery by using ONLY the Terminal to navigate files. **Don't use a text editor** to view any files except `readme.md` and `cheatsheet.md`.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `dev` folder on your local machine.

2. Change directories into `command-line-mystery`:

	```bash
	$ cd command-line-mystery
	```

3. Inside `command-line-mystery`, create a new file called `solution.md`:

	```bash
	$ touch solution.md
	```

4. When you're ready to dive into detective work, start by reading the `instructions` file:

	```bash
	$ cat instructions
	```

5. As you work to solve the mystery, **keep track of all the Terminal commands you type** by recording them in `solution.md` (you're allowed to use your text editor for this part). When you figure out who committed the crime, add the culprit's name to `solution.md` as well.

## Submission

* As you make changes to `solution.md`, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
